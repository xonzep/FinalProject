<div style="text-align: center;"><h3>Turn-based Battle Game</h3></div>

This is a turn-based battle game battle game built to requirements for C# Player's guide final project.
It's built for learning, so things are done correctly to the best of my understanding and current ability. If you stumble upon this yourself 
while doing the project, know that this is just one way of doing it hacked together by someone six months in. 
I will probably refactor some things later (the menu system feels all kinds of on convoluted and can be streamlined some from things I learn building this). 

If you feel so inclined 
to give constructive feedback I'm open to it.
